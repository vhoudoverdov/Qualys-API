This module provides a PowerShell implementation of the Qualys API.

Several functions are provided as part of this module, including various ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) functions and mechanisms to interact with vulnerability scans (including the ability to launch, pause, resume, and cancel vulnerability scans).

I'm still in the process of translating many of the functions into this module from my original implementation of the Qualys API module.
